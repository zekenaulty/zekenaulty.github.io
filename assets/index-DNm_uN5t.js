      <section class="about">My journey in software development began in the late 1990s, when I landed my first tech job at Litton Avondale Inc. 
      Working on the cutting-edge LPD-17 project, I was tasked with writing 3D to 2D code transformations, deploying network applications, 
      and building robust error-handling systems. This experience not only laid the foundation for my technical skills but also instilled 
      in me a passion for innovation and collaboration.</section>

      <section class="about">As I progressed in my career, I had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from desktop development to web applications. 
      I developed a strong foundation in programming languages, including C/C++, C#, JavaScript and VB/VB.Net; and I became proficient in various development 
      frameworks and tools. My early experiences taught me the importance of adaptability, effective communication, and teamwork in a fast-paced environment.</section>

      <header class="h4">Early Development Experience</header>
      <section class="about">My early development experience was marked by a series of challenging and rewarding projects. As an Engineering Application Developer at 
      Litton Avondale Inc., I wrote 3D to 2D code transformations, managed network application deployment, and developed error reporting/logging databases 
      and front-ends. One of my notable achievements was creating an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for scripting 3D to 2D transformations. 
      This experience not only deepened my understanding of software development but also instilled in me a passion for innovation and problem-solving.</section>
      
      <section class="about">At Hancock Whitney, I worked as a Programmer/Analyst I, where I was responsible for desktop development, accessing/managing DB2 data sources, and 
      implementing data applications using Argo Data. I designed reporting and data access front-ends, created data-driven ASP pages, and developed a 
      strong foundation in database management. These experiences taught me the importance of attention to detail, data integrity, and effective data visualization.</section>

      <section class="about">Throughout these early experiences, I was fortunate to work with talented teams and mentors who guided me in my growth as a developer. 
      I learned the value of collaboration, open communication, and continuous learning in delivering high-quality software solutions. These lessons have 
      stayed with me throughout my career and continue to shape my approach to software development.</section>
      
      <section class="about">As a Design Consultant at Rainmaker Advertising & Design, I assisted in the design and implementation of IT systems, developed components and 
      front-ends using VB6, ASP.Net, ASP Classic, ASP.Net Web Forms, Microsoft Access (it's true), Microsoft InterDev, Macromedia/Adobe Flash, Adobe Photoshop, 
      Adobe Image Ready, and Microsoft SQL Server. This experience broadened my understanding of software development and taught me the importance of considering user experience and design principles 
      in software development.</section>
      
      <header class="h4">Expanding My Horizons</header>
      <section class="about">As I progressed in my career, I had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and technologies. At Solid Earth Inc., I developed and 
      maintained the RETS client and server software powered by Oracle and C#. I also developed configurable ASP.Net web applications, using xml metadata, for distinct MLS 
      custom implementations and built a full statistics module with deep market analytics and reporting. This experience deepened my understanding of 
      software development and instilled in me a passion for innovation and problem-solving.</section>

      <section class="about">As a Senior Software Developer at Rural Sourcing Inc., I provided mentoring, team management, and project management in relation to the Microsoft stack. 
      I also performed recruiting and interviewing tasks, which helped me develop my leadership and communication skills. I worked with talented teams to deliver 
      high-quality software solutions, and my experience in this role taught me the importance of effective collaboration, open communication, and continuous 
      learning.</section>

      <section class="about">At PK Promotions, I developed web-based commodity production management systems, product evolution tracking systems, and sales/marketing systems. 
      This experience broadened my understanding of software development and taught me the importance of considering user experience and design principles in software 
      development. I also expanded my foundation in web development, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</section>

      <section class="about">Throughout these experiences, I continued to expand my skill set and knowledge of software development. I learned new programming languages, frameworks,
       and tools, and I developed a deep understanding of software engineering principles and best practices. I also learned the importance of staying up-to-date with 
       industry trends and emerging technologies, and I continue to pursue ongoing learning and professional development in my career.</section>
