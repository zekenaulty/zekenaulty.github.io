Senior .NET Full Stack Developer
AboutAbout
I love solving problems, creative thinking, critical thinking, and working with a team to create solutions. I would rather follow and provide options than lead, but I am always open to a challenge.

I’ve been developing and designing software since the late 1990’s. I began with VB3, VB4, and VB5; eventually I moved into InterDev, FrontPage, slicing user interfaces with Photoshop, and tweening with Flash and ActionScript. I’ve dabbled in C++ and reversing with IDA Pro etc. I’ve done everything from PERL to ColdFusion, ASP.Net WebAPI/MVC. 

I’m very excited to keep moving into the new frontiers of development and to see where we go next. I’m enjoying diving into CouchDB, Blockchain, and JavaScript eco systems and can’t wait to take them further.
