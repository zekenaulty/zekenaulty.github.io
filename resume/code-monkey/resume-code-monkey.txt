ZEKE NAULTY
CODE MONKEY (DEFAULT)
Senior .NET Engineer / Code Monkey for Messy Systems (C#, .NET Core, WinForms, ASP.NET)

SUMMARY
-------
Most of my career has been spent inside complex systems: long-lived .NET codebases, awkward architectures, and business processes that grew faster than anyone designed them. The more tangled the problem, the clearer the map becomes.

I take responsibility for hard systems other people depend on, learn how they really work, and make them easier to change. That has meant living deep in C#, .NET Core, WinForms, ASP.NET, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL—untangling apps and nudging teams toward testable, maintainable designs.

Systems are not neutral; they decide who carries risk and who fights fires. I prefer building things that reduce hidden load and failure modes instead of chasing whatever is trending.

Outside of work it is quieter - cooking, biking, games, and reading - but the same habit shows up: notice patterns, refine systems, and leave them better than I found them.
