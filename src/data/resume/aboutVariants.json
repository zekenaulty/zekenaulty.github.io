      "Most of my career has been spent inside complex systems: long-lived .NET codebases, awkward architectures, and business processes that grew faster than anyone designed them. The more tangled the problem, the clearer the map becomes.",
      "I take responsibility for hard systems other people depend on, learn how they really work, and make them easier to change. That has meant living deep in C#, .NET Core, WinForms, ASP.NET, SQL Server, and PostgreSQL—untangling apps and nudging teams toward testable, maintainable designs.",
      "Systems are not neutral; they decide who carries risk and who fights fires. I prefer building things that reduce hidden load and failure modes instead of chasing whatever is trending.",
      "Outside of work it is quieter - cooking, biking, games, and reading - but the same habit shows up: notice patterns, refine systems, and leave them better than I found them."
